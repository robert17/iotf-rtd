msgid "When you register with the Internet of Things Foundation you are given an organization ID, this is a unique 6 character identifier for your account."
msgstr ""
"當您在 Internet of Things Foundation 中登錄時，會獲得一個組織 ID，這是您帳戶的唯一 6 字元 ID。"

#: ..\docs\reference\concepts.rst:10
msgid "**Organizations** ensure your data is only accessible from your devices and applications.  Once registered, devices and API keys are bound to a single organization.  When an application connects to the service using an API key it registers with the organization that \"owns\" the API key."
msgstr ""
"**組織** 確保您的資料只能透過裝置和應用程式進行存取。登錄之後，裝置和 API 金鑰會連結到單一組織。當應用程式使用 API 金鑰連接到服務時，它會在「擁有」API 金鑰的組織中登錄。"

#: ..\docs\reference\concepts.rst:15
msgid "For your security it is impossible for cross-organization communication within the Internet of Things Foundation eco-system, intentional or otherwise.  The only way to transmit data between two organizations it to explicitly create two applications, one within each organization, that communicate with each other to act as a relay between the organizations."
msgstr ""
"基於安全理由，不論是有意或無意，要在 Internet of Things Foundation 生態系統內進行跨組織通訊是行不通的。在兩個組織之間傳輸資料的唯一方式，是明確建立兩個應用程式（每一個組織內各一個）來彼此進行通訊，以扮演組織之間的中繼角色。"

msgid "A device can be anything that has a connection to the internet and has data it wants to get into the cloud."
msgstr ""
"裝置可以是連線到網際網路且含有它想要放入雲端的資料的任何項目。"

msgid "A device is not able to directly interact with other devices."
msgstr ""
"裝置無法直接與其他裝置互動。"

msgid "Devices are able to accept commands from applications."
msgstr ""
"裝置可接受來自應用程式的指令。"

#: ..\docs\reference\concepts.rst:28
msgid "Devices uniquely identify themselves to the IoT Foundation with an authentication token that will only be accepted for that device."
msgstr ""
"裝置可利用只有該裝置才接受的鑑別記號在 IoT Foundation 中唯一地識別自己。"

#: ..\docs\reference\concepts.rst:30
msgid "Devices must be registered before they can connect to the IoT Foundation."
msgstr ""
"必須先登錄裝置，這些裝置才能連接到 IoT Foundation。"

"應用程式是連線到網際網路且要與來自裝置的資料進行互動，及/或以某種方式控制那些裝置行為的任何項目。"

msgid "Applications do not need to be registered before they can connect to the IoT Foundation, however they must present a valid API key that has previously been registered."
msgstr ""
"應用程式不需要先登錄就可以連接到 IoT Foundation，不過，它們必須提出先前已登錄過的有效 API 金鑰。"

msgid "Events are the mechanism by which **devices** publish data to the Internet of Things Foundation.  The device controls the content of the event and assigns a name for each event it sends."
msgstr ""
"事件是 **裝置** 藉以將資料發佈到 Internet of Things Foundation 的機制。裝置可控制事件的內容，並為它傳送的每一個事件指派一個名稱。"

#: ..\docs\reference\concepts.rst:51
msgid "When an event is received by the IoT Foundation the credentials of the connection on which the event was received are used to determine from which device the event was sent.  With this architecture it is impossible for a device to impersonate another device."
msgstr ""
"當 IoT Foundation 接收事件時，會使用接收事件之連線的認證來判定是從哪個裝置傳送事件。在此架構下，裝置無法假冒另一個裝置。"

#: ..\docs\reference\concepts.rst:56
msgid "**Devices** are unable to receive events, regardless of whether they are its own events or those of another device."
msgstr ""
"**裝置** 無法接收事件，不論它們是裝置本身的事件還是另一個裝置的事件。"

#: ..\docs\reference\concepts.rst:59
msgid "**Applications** are able to process events from devices in real time.  When an application receives an event it has visibility of the source of the event and the data contained in that event.  Applications can be configured to subscribe to all events from all devices, a subset of events, a subset of devices or a combination of these events."
msgstr ""
"**應用程式** 可以即時處理來自裝置的事件。當應用程式接收事件時，它可以看到事件的來源和包含在該事件中的資料。應用程式可配置為訂閱來自所有裝置的所有事件、事件子集、裝置子集或這些事件的組合。"

"**指令** 是 **應用程式** 可藉以與 **裝置** 進行通訊的機制。只有應用程式可傳送必須對特定裝置發出的指令。"

#: ..\docs\reference\concepts.rst:72
msgid "The device must determine which action to take on receipt of any given command, and even controls which commands it will subscribe to in the first place.  It is possible to design your device to listen for any command, or to simply subscribe to a set of specific commands."
msgstr ""
"裝置必須決定在接收到任何給定的指令時要採取的動作，甚至控制它將率先訂閱哪些指令。可以設計裝置來接聽任何指令，或只訂閱一組特定指令。"
